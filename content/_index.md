# Welcome to Literal Byte 👋

Most websites today are an assault on attention. They are bloated with ads, overloaded with AI-generated fluff, optimized not for people but for search engines. Every page tries to squeeze the maximum clicks out of your time, sacrificing clarity, elegance, and meaning.  

Slow load times, endless popups, clashing colors, meaningless animations. These are the hallmarks of a web over-engineered and under-cared for. The user is treated as a metric, not a human.  

Here, that stops. Literal Byte is different. Minimal, clean, fast, intentional. 

We live in *fragments*: moments of clarity punctuated by the noise of our daily lives.  

Here, I write not to answer, but to explore; not to instruct, but to ponder.  

If curiosity moves you, stay awhile. Read. Reflect. Wander through these musings. Perhaps they will resonate, perhaps they will challenge but always, I hope, they will provoke thought.
