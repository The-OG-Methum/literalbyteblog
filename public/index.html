This space is an experiment in thought—a digital canvas where ideas, reflections, and questions gather. Here, I write not to answer, but to explore; not to instruct, but to ponder.
Time flows, systems evolve, and yet the questions remain. What is meaningful? What is real? How does one navigate the vastness of information, the tides of thought, and the impermanence of our own existence?">

<h1 id="welcome-to-literal-byte-">Welcome to Literal Byte 👋</h1>
<p>We live in fragments: moments of clarity punctuated by the noise of our daily lives.</p>
<p>This space is an experiment in thought—a digital canvas where ideas, reflections, and questions gather. Here, I write not to answer, but to explore; not to instruct, but to ponder.</p>
<p>Time flows, systems evolve, and yet the questions remain. What is meaningful? What is real? How does one navigate the vastness of information, the tides of thought, and the impermanence of our own existence?</p>
<p>If curiosity moves you, stay awhile. Read. Reflect. Wander through these musings. Perhaps they will resonate, perhaps they will challenge—but always, I hope, they will provoke thought.</p>
