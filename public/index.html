<p>Most websites today are an assault on attention. They are bloated with ads, overloaded with AI-generated fluff, optimized not for people but for search engines. Every page tries to squeeze the maximum clicks out of your time, sacrificing clarity, elegance, and meaning.</p>
<p>Slow load times, endless popups, clashing colors, meaningless animations. These are the hallmarks of a web over-engineered and under-cared for. The user is treated as a metric, not a human.</p>
<p>Here, that stops. Literal Byte is different. Minimal, clean, fast, intentional. I write not to answer, but to explore; not to instruct, but to ponder.</p>
<p>We live in <em>fragments</em>: moments of clarity punctuated by the noise of our daily lives.</p>
<p>If curiosity moves you, stay awhile. Read. Reflect. Wander through these musings. Perhaps they will resonate, perhaps they will challenge but always, I hope, they will provoke thought.</p>
